Given that this is the first version, **all Z-Items are treated as neutral**.

Therefore, it does not matter if the character equipping these items is evil or not.

Upon execution, the number of Z-Items is also random, and the sum of their costs is up to 7, aka what the game calls the **Ability Limit**.
